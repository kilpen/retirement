                <h2>The Retirement Ceremony</h2>
            </header>
		<p>The Naval retirement ceremony is the nation's expression of appreciation for a job well done and a sincere official recognition of a long period of faithful and honorable service. Often referred to as "swallowing the anchor," it is a day of great significance, marking the end of a richly rewarding way of life, living and working aboard ships, sailing the world's oceans in defense of freedom. Shipmates from the member's last duty station are formally assembled, highlights
			of the member's career are reviewed, awards and commendations cited, and a senior Officer properly bids the member farewell.</p>
		<p>During the ceremony the member is presented with mementos recognizing and expressing the nation's appreciation for twenty or more years of service. The United States flag is presented to the retiree and is of special significance. Each Navy day begins with the ceremony of hoisting colors at 0800 and ends with lowering them at dusk. The member
			has lived figuratively under its folds’ day and night for his whole career. The salutes in its honor at home and abroad, its appearance at sea and in foreign ports, and the careful and ceremonious way in which it is handled all deepen its hold on heart and memory. It is a visible national symbol of the country they have served with honor and will always remind them of the precious freedom they defended so well.</p>
		<p>The ceremony concludes when for one last time their shipmates pipe them "over the side." This is a distinct Naval courtesy, a seaman's tribute, and a final farewell whistled three times on the boatswain's pipe. This pipe is one of the oldest and most distinctive articles of personal nautical equipment used to salute distinguished persons as well as to pass orders.</p>

            </header>
            <p>I am the flag of the United States of America; my name is "Old Glory". I fly atop the world's tallest buildings, I stand watch in America's halls of justice. I fly majestically over great institutions of learning, I stand guard with the greatest
                military power in the world. Look up and see me!</p>
            <p>I stand for peace, honor, truth and justice. I stand for freedom. I am confident. I am arrogant. I am proud. When I am flown with my fellow banners, My head is a little higher, my colors a little truer, I bow to no one!</p>
            <p>I am recognized all over the world, I am worshipped, I am saluted, I am respected. I am revered, I am loved, and I am feared!</p>
            <p>I have fought in every battle of every war for more than 200 years: Gettysburg, Shiloh, Appomattox, San Juan Hill, the trenches of France, the Argonne Forest, Anzio, Rome, the beaches of Normandy, Guam, Okinawa, Tarawa, Korea, Vietnam, the
                Persian Gulf and a scores of places long forgotten by all, except by those who were there with me, I was there!</p>
            <p>I led my Sailors and Marines, I followed them, I watched over them, they love me! I was on a small hill on Iwo Jima, I was dirty, battle worn and tired, but my Sailors and Marines cheered me! And I was proud!</p>
            <p>I was at ground zero in New York City on September 11th as cowardly fanatics attacked America. I was raised from the ashes of once proud buildings by brave firefighters. Heroes, who risk their lives to save others, showing all that America,
                although bloodied, will never be beaten.</p>
            <p>Those who would destroy me can not win, for I am the symbol of freedom, of one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all.</p>
            <p>I have been soiled, burned, torn, and trampled on the streets of my own country and when it is by those whom I have served with in battle, it hurts. But I shall overcome, for I am strong! I have slipped the surely bonds of Earth and from my
                vantage point on the moon; I stand watch over the uncharted new frontiers of space.</p>
            <p>I have been a silent witness to all of America's finest hours, but my finest hour comes when I am torn into strips, to be used as bandages for my wounded comrades on the field of battle, when I fly half-mast to honor my soldiers, and when
                I lie in the trembling arms of a grieving mother, at the grave-site of her fallen son or daughter, I am proud</p>
            <p>MY NAME IS "OLD GLORY", LONG MAY I WAVE. DEAR GOD, LONG MAY I WAVE!</p>

                <h2>The Navy Spouse</h2>
            </header>
            <p>A Navy Spouse is no ordinary person. Operating for months at a time without the companionship or assistance of his husband, he routinely overcomes challenges that would give the average person a nervous breakdown. </p>
            <p>Part Doctor, part Teacher and part Handyman, he can lavish loving care on a sick toddler, help a teenager with his Algebra homework, and track down a faulty circuit breaker -- all while holding down a full time job.</p>
            <p>With thirty minutes notice, he can serve breakfast, lunch, or dinner to fourteen hungry Sailors, and still somehow balance his family's meager grocery budget.</p>
            <p>He can press a set of dress whites to inspection standards, tie a perfect square knot in a military neckerchief, and pack a seabag in the cold hours before dawn.</p>
            <p>For months at a time, he must settle for letters instead of kisses, emails in place of hugs, and long-distance phone calls in lieu of his husband's touch. He manages a smile when his Sailor is at sea for the second Anniversary in a row, and
                accepts the fact that there's a one-in-three chance that he will have to stand Duty on his Birthday. He has learned to stand on a pier and wave goodbye without tears, even when his heart is breaking.</p>
            <p>To his children, he is Chauffeur, Umpire, Psychologist, Spiritual Advisor, Financial Consultant, part-time Father, Tooth Fairy, Santa Clause, and the Easter Bunny. To his husband, he is Friend, Lover, Partner, Confidant, and Soul-Mate.</p>
            <p>He is a patriot. He is the sort of citizen that all of us should be, but so few of us are. He lives with sacrifice, because He believes in the rights and ideals that his husband defends. Although He wears no uniform, he is a part of that defense
                -- a vital link in the chain of Freedom. Although he wears no medals and will reap no glory on the field of battle, he is a hero in the truest sense of the word.</p>
            <p> HE IS A NAVY SPOUSE</p>

            <p>He stood the watch for twenty years</p>
            <p>He stood the watch so that we, our families and our fellow countrymen could sleep soundly in safety, each and every night knowing that a Sailor stood the watch</p>

            </header>
            <h3>Color Guard</h3>
            <p> Since early history, flags and banners have been used by armies in battle. They served to assist in identifying units, to signal movements and be a common point of reference for soldiers on the field, which allowed them to keep formations
                organized. The flag was a symbol of the unit and to loose it was shameful and could cause the unit to break up. So, for this reason, leaders developed an elite group of men whose job it was to protect the flag.</p>
            <h3>Side Boys</h3>
            <p>In the days of sail, it was not uncommon for the Commanding Officers of ships sailing in convoy to convene aboard the flagship for conferences. It was also not uncommon for COs to invite each other to dine aboard their vessels. Unfortunately,
                there was no easy way to bring visitors on and off a ship while underway. And there was no dignified way for a high-ranking officer to scurry up or down a rope or ladder hanging down the side of a ship. Often the boatswain’s chair, a rope
                and wood sling, would be used to hoist the guest onto and off the ship. The Boatswain’s Mate would control the heaving by blowing the appropriate commands with a whistle known as a Boatswain’s Pipe. The number of “strong backs” needed
                to bring the visitor aboard depended upon the size of the “load” being hoisted. Somewhere along the line, it was noted the more senior the visitor’s rank, the more Sailors were needed to “man the side.” Over time, the need to hoist visitors
                on and off Navy ships went away, but the custom of mustering the Sideboys and piping distinguished visitors aboard ship remained.
